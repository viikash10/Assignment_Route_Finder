# Route Finder Application

This application finds it's usage in areas like US where most of the roads are unexplored. Fitness enthusiasts who like to run get bored following a single route. So make a web app ( Not android ) which will find most of it's usage in phone UI. App would be able to suggest new routes everyday after taking KMs or Miles as a input from User, Route needs to be approximately of that distance. Route should end at the same point where it started.
